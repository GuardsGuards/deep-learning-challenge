Alphabet Soup Charity: Deep Learning Challenge
Overview
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup is looking for a tool that can help it select applicants for funding who have the best chance of success in their ventures. Using machine learning and neural networks, we aim to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Dataset
The dataset provided contains metadata for over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. This includes columns such as:

EIN and NAME: Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE: Type of application submitted to Alphabet Soup
AFFILIATION: Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION: Government organization classification
USE_CASE: Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION: Type of organization
STATUS: Active or inactive status
INCOME_AMT: Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for the application
ASK_AMT: Requested funding amount
IS_SUCCESSFUL: Binary target variable indicating if the funds were used successfully
Project Steps
Step 1: Preprocess the Data
Pandas and scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler() were used to preprocess the dataset and prepare it for training.
EIN and NAME columns were dropped as they were not relevant for predictions.
Features with more than 10 unique values were binned into "Other" categories.
The dataset was one-hot encoded to handle categorical variables.
Data was split into features (X) and target (y) arrays, and further divided into training and testing sets.
The data was then standardized using StandardScaler().
Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
A neural network was designed using TensorFlow and Keras to build a binary classification model.
The model was trained with various combinations of hidden layers and neurons, with relu activation functions for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer.
A callback was created to save model weights after every 5 epochs.
The model was evaluated on test data to determine loss and accuracy.
Results were saved as AlphabetSoupCharity.h5.
Step 3: Optimize the Model
The model was further optimized to achieve an accuracy greater than 75% by:
Adjusting input data by removing unnecessary columns and handling outliers.
Changing the number of neurons and hidden layers.
Tuning the number of epochs and testing different activation functions.
Step 4: Report on the Neural Network Model
The report covers:
Data Preprocessing: Identifying the target and feature variables, removing irrelevant columns.
Model Compilation and Training: Explanation of layers, neurons, and activation functions used.
Model Evaluation: Steps taken to improve performance, and a summary of the results.
Recommendation: A recommendation for how another model (such as Random Forest or XGBoost) could solve the problem more effectively.
Conclusion
The neural network model was successful in predicting whether Alphabet Soup-funded organizations would be successful, achieving accuracy close to the target threshold of 75%. Further tuning and optimization steps were documented, with insights on how alternative machine learning models could enhance the predictions.
